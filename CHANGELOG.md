### performance

- PNG decoding hands each decoded row to the frame it belongs in instead of
  building the whole picture in a buffer the plugin then copies, which is one
  pass over the image rather than two: 1.2x on the decoded side of every PNG
  set measured, and a frame is byte for byte identical either way
  - this reaches every colour type and bit depth, `tRNS` on grey, rgb and
    palette, and an odd width; an interlaced or animated file, and one the
    caller asked to rotate, still goes through the `image` decoder
  - a grey page is a copy per row and a colour page a single walk over the row
    that fills all three planes, so `Read` no longer pays a second pass at all
  - a palette page is expanded by the plugin rather than by the decoder, which
    is one pass over one byte per pixel where `Transformations::EXPAND` is a
    pass over three: a further 1.10x on the pages made of them
  - every png set measured is now ahead of Pillow's own decode column, from
    0.89x to 0.69x of its time
- x86-64 wheels carry one plugin library per microarchitecture level, and
  VapourSynth loads the widest the machine's CPU supports: 6% to 11% faster on
  the PNG and JPEG sets measured, almost all of it in the write into the frame
  - the libraries are `vs_imageseqs.dll`, `vs_imageseqs.avx2.dll` for AVX2 and
    `vs_imageseqs.avx512.dll` for AVX-512, and a unix wheel names the same
    three with a `lib` prefix and a `.so` extension
  - all three decode identically, and the plain library still passes no
    `-C target-cpu`, so a machine that could load the plugin before still can
  - the Windows wheel is 10.4 MiB instead of 3.8 MiB, which is what the three
    builds cost

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-30

### build

- fix wrong version number in the plugin manifest itself.
- macOS arm64 wheels and standalone plugin ZIPs include dav1d and libde265, so
  users do not need to install those runtime libraries separately; they target
  macOS 11 or later

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### added

- animated GIF, APNG, WebP, JPEG XL, AVIF and HEIF/HEIC inputs now play their
  displayed timeline instead of contributing one frame
  - each output frame shows the picture the file displays at that instant, sampled
    onto the clip's own `fpsnum`/`fpsden`, so a fractional rate and a delay that
    does not divide it both land where the file says
  - a picture with no delay is held for one output tick rather than dropped, and a
    file's loop count is ignored: each listed path plays once
  - a 16-bit APNG stays 16-bit, and a HEIF or AVIF sequence is cropped to the
    picture it presents rather than handed out as coded
  - still images keep their frame count, format, pixels and metadata whether or
    not they share a list with animations
  - a colour-only read of a HEIF sequence still decodes its alpha track, because
    the library gives no way to skip it

### fixed

- a frame request on an AVIF whose item holds no coded frame no longer hangs
  forever; it fails with a decode error naming the file
  - the item decoder now runs at low latency, which is what lets "the decoder has
    all of the item and has no picture" be told apart from "the picture is still
    being decoded"
- an AVIF or HEIF/HEIC that states its orientation as the `irot` and `imir` item
  properties is now handed out the way the file describes it
  - `ImgSeqOrientation` reports the equivalent EXIF code instead of `1` for such
    a file, and `apply_rotation=False` hands the stored picture back at the
    stored size, which neither container could do before
  - a container transform is the normative statement for these two formats, so an
    EXIF tag beside one stays informational and is not applied on top of it
- an AVIF whose item is split over several extents now decodes instead of failing
  every frame request
  - the container reader does not join extents, so such a file is described as the
    format the fallback decoder produces rather than as the YUV its samples are;
    that decoder does join them
- a malformed AVIF container is refused instead of being read past its own bounds
  - an extent the file does not hold is no longer allocated before the read that
    fails on it, an `iloc` field wider than an address no longer shifts a value
    out of its type, and a box with an extended size header is read with the whole
    header rather than the last eight bytes of it being dropped
- a colour-only read of an AVIF no longer fails on a file whose alpha item is
  broken
  - the alpha item is a coded item of its own and is not part of what `Read` hands
    out, so it is not read; `ReadAlpha` still reports the problem on the same file

### performance

- AVIF decoding is 15.6% faster on the 35-page sandbox set, and 43% faster on
  `sandbox/hitokage-sample`: a still image is one frame, so the item is decoded
  directly instead of through a frame-delay pipeline it cannot use
- reading a container's orientation costs 0.006 ms per AVIF file and 0.037 ms per
  HEIF file at clip creation, and nothing per frame
- bounding an AVIF item's extent costs one file metadata call per file at clip
  creation, 0.005 ms per file, and nothing per frame
- a read that hands out no alpha clip no longer decodes an AVIF's alpha item,
  which is a coded item of its own: 11–20% off a colour-only read of an
  alpha-bearing page, with the colour planes byte identical
- a probe no longer keeps a file's embedded ICC profile unless `icc_profile=True`
  asks for it, which is 36 MiB off a 35-file clip whose files each carry a 1 MiB
  profile; `ImgSeqHasICC` is unchanged
- a still image reads as fast as it did before, on every sandbox set and at every
  lookahead depth, so animations cost the still path nothing

### build

- improvement to linux wheel distribution, manylinux now has dropped down to glibc 2.28
  - linux build now bundles `libdav1d.so.7` and `libde265.so.0` to avoid runtime dependency issues
- change the plugin layout to become `plugins/imageseqs/` with a `manifest.vs` file, and the plugin loader path to `$ORIGIN/lib`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-20

the first release of `vapoursynth-imageseqs`, a native image-sequence source
for VapourSynth.

### added

- `Read` for ordered image sequences and `ReadAlpha` for separate color and
  alpha clips.
- support for PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, HEIF/HEIC, JPEG XL, JPEG 2000, DDS,
  farbfeld, TIFF, EXR, HDR, PNM, QOI, TGA, BMP, GIF, and ICO.
- native YUV output for compatible WebP, HEIF/HEIC, AVIF, and JPEG 2000
  sources.
- nominal 9–15-bit formats, including 10-bit and 12-bit gray, RGB, alpha,
  and YUV output.
- EXIF and codestream orientation handling through `apply_rotation`.
- CICP and container color metadata as VapourSynth frame properties.
- optional embedded ICC profile export through the binary `ICCProfile` frame
  property.
- variable-size and variable-format sequences through `mismatch`.
- background prefetching with a bounded memory budget.
- `debug` timing logs for probing, decoding, frame writing, and properties.

### performance

- native libwebp decoding and direct lossy WebP YUV output.
- direct HEIF and AVIF plane output where the container metadata permits it.
- JPEG XL and JPEG 2000 header-only probing before frame requests.
- frame construction moved into the prefetch workers to reduce request-thread
  work.
